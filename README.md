# xUnit Intro Project

This is a simple project showcasing xUnit testing in c# ASP .NET Core. If you're only interested in seeing an example for xUnit, find the CalculatorTest class.
* Tip: make sure you install Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk to make the test explorer actually work properly. View -> Test Explorer -> Run and Build (or something i don't remember exactly).
* Also install the xUnit packages: xUnit, xUnit.visualstudio (i think these are the only ones that are needed, but xUnit.runnerconsole may also be one), via NuGet PM
